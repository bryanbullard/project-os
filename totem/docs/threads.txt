Idle Thread:

The "kernel-mode" thread that is created in the executives
process space that runs when no other thread can run.  It
the only thread that runs at the lowest possible priority.
This thread starts execution at "normal" interrupt level
and may be pre-empted by the scheduler.

User Thread:

Normal user threads that is created in a user process 
space that can trap into the executive by means of kernel 
system calls.  This thread starts execution at "normal" 
interrupt level and may be pre-empted by the scheduler.

Kernel Thread:

A "kernel-mode" thread that is created in the executive's
process space that can run at any priority except idle
priority.  This thread starts execution at "normal" 
interrupt level and may be pre-empted by the scheduler.

User Service thread:

A thread that is normally created in a user process space 
that only runs in "kernel-mode".  It is queued by a device 
driver to complete a long io request from user mode.  These
Thread run at a priority that is higher than user threads.
This thread starts execution at "normal" interrupt level 
and may be pre-empted by the scheduler.

Device Service thread:

A "kernel-mode" thread that is created in the executive's
process space that run in a range of the most high priorities.  
The actual priority is determined by the associated interrupt 
level the device runs at.  It is designed for processing device
interrupts.  This thread starts execution at "normal" interrupt 
level and may be pre-empted by the scheduler.

Device Signal Thread:

A "kernel-mode" thread that is created automatically in the 
executive's process for handling device interrupts.  This 
threads should stop their device from signaling, read the 
devices state as needed and then past the rest of the processing
to a Device Service Thread.  This thread starts execution at an 
interrupt level that is determined by the driver and is not
subject to the scheduler.
